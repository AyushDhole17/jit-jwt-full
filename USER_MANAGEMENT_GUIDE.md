6. **device**: Device management
7. **alerts**: Alert management

### Default Actions

## üí° Best Practices

### Role Design

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Give only necessary permissions
2. **Role Naming**: Use clear, descriptive names
3. **Documentation**: Always add meaningful descriptions
4. **Priority Levels**: Maintain consistent hierarchy
5. **Regular Review**: Periodically audit roles and permissions

### User Management

1. **Onboarding**: Assign appropriate roles immediately
2. **Offboarding**: Deactivate first, delete later if needed
3. **Role Changes**: Use role assignment instead of direct permissions
4. **Monitoring**: Regularly review active users
5. **Security**: Deactivate suspicious accounts immediately

### Security

1. **Admin Access**: Limit admin role assignments
2. **System Roles**: Never modify system-critical roles
3. **Audit Logs**: Monitor user and role changes
4. **Token Management**: Ensure tokens refresh properly
5. **Access Review**: Quarterly access review recommended

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Can't See Roles/Users

**Symptoms**: Empty list, no data showing

**Solutions**:
1. Check if you're logged in as admin
2. Verify backend is running
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Verify seed data exists (`npm run seed:rbac`)
5. Check network tab for API errors

#### Role Assignment Fails

**Symptoms**: Error when assigning role to user

**Solutions**:
1. Verify role ID is valid
2. Check if user exists
3. Ensure you have admin privileges
4. Check backend logs for errors

#### Can't Delete Role

**Symptoms**: Delete button disabled or fails

**Possible Causes**:
- Role is a system role (protected)
- Role is assigned to users
- Insufficient permissions

**Solutions**:
- Unassign role from all users first
- Cannot delete system roles

#### Permissions Not Working

**Symptoms**: User can't access features after role assignment

**Solutions**:
1. Verify permissions are assigned to the role
2. User may need to log out and log back in
3. Check token refresh is working
4. Verify roleRef is populated in user object

#### Search Not Working

**Symptoms**: Search doesn't filter results

**Solutions**:
1. Clear search box and try again
2. Refresh the page
3. Check if data is loaded
4. Try different search terms

### Getting Help

1. **Console Logs**: Check browser console for errors
2. **Network Tab**: Verify API calls are successful
3. **Backend Logs**: Check server logs for errors
4. **Documentation**: Review this guide and API docs
5. **Token Status**: Use `tokenTest.checkTokens()` in console
