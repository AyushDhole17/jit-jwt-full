# KYC Verification Feature Implementation Summary

## Feature Overview

Added complete KYC (Know Your Customer) verification functionality to the Customer Management page, allowing bank administrators to verify or reject customer identity documents before they can access banking services.

## What Was Added

### 1. UI Components

#### Action Buttons in Customer Table

- ✅ **Verify Button** (Green check icon) - For pending/in_review customers
- ❌ **Reject Button** (Red cancel icon) - For pending/in_review customers
- 👁️ **View Button** - For all customers to view details

#### KYC Verification Dialog

A comprehensive dialog that displays:

- Customer summary (Name, ID, Email, Mobile)
- KYC document details (PAN, Aadhaar)
- Personal information (DOB, Occupation)
- Complete address
- Confirmation message
- Action buttons (Cancel, Verify/Reject)

#### KYC Rejection Dialog

Enhanced dialog for rejections with:

- All customer KYC details
- Required rejection reason text field
- Warning message about rejection impact
- Validation (rejection reason mandatory)

### 2. State Management

Added new state variables:

```javascript
const [openKYCDialog, setOpenKYCDialog] = useState(false);
const [kycAction, setKycAction] = useState("verify"); // 'verify' or 'reject'
const [rejectionReason, setRejectionReason] = useState("");
```

### 3. Handler Functions

#### `handleOpenKYCDialog(customer, action)`

- Opens the KYC verification/rejection dialog
- Sets the selected customer
- Sets the action type (verify/reject)
- Resets rejection reason

#### `handleCloseKYCDialog()`

- Closes the KYC dialog
- Resets all KYC-related state
- Clears rejection reason

#### `handleKYCVerification()`

- Calls the API to verify or reject KYC
- Shows success/error notifications
- Refreshes customer list
- Handles loading states

### 4. Enhanced KYC Status Display

Updated status chip to show all 4 statuses with proper colors:

```javascript
{
  pending: 'warning' (yellow),
  in_review: 'info' (blue),
  verified: 'success' (green),
  rejected: 'error' (red)
}
```

### 5. Conditional Button Display

Verify and Reject buttons only appear when:

```javascript
customer.kyc?.verificationStatus === "pending" ||
  customer.kyc?.verificationStatus === "in_review";
```

Already verified or rejected customers only show the View button.

## API Integration
